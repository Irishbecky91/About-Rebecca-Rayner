## A little bit about me 

**Hello there :wave::grinning:**

My name is Rebecca Rayner. I'm from the UK but living in Ireland, and am a full stack software developer in training. 

Before starting the full stack course with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), I had only tried some basic coding using a mobile app called [Mimo](https://getmimo.com/). I have always been fascinated by how things work, including websites. I finally decided to try it out and now I'm hooked!

Learning the basics from this app was the push I needed to start my coding journey as I found not only a new hobby, but a passion I wished to pursue as a career.
